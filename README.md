# VUTTR

This is a project done for [BossaBox](https://bossabox.com)'s challenge

For the sake of simplicity I will not use environment variables, this project will be as simple as running `npm install` and `npm run dev`. All you need to make sure is that you have a local host running for mongodb on port `mongodb://localhost:27017` without password. This way we do not use much time to set the project.

## Instructions:

In the project directory, you can run:

`npm install`

It should install all dependencies, now run:

`npm run dev`

It will start the server on port 3000.
